# HTML-CSS-Task-6 & 7
## About the Project

This project contains both the HTML and CSS files in the same repository.

If you want to view the raw HTML without any styling, you can simply comment out the CSS link in the `<head>` section of the HTML file, like this:

```html
<!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> -->
